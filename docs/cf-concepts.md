# Cloud Foundry Concepts

There are [many ways](integration-types.md) to integrate products with Cloud Foundry.
The right one for each product depends on what the product does, and how
customer applications consume it. To determine the best way to integrate your
product, you'll need a good understanding of Cloud Foundry concepts
like applications, containers, services, brokers, and buildpacks.

This page provides a collection of links to documentation for the most relevant
concepts. If you prefer to learn through guided training,
